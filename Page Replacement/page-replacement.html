      <h2>Introduction to Page Replacement</h2>
      <p>Page replacement is a crucial concept in operating systems that comes into play when a page fault occurs and there are no free frames available in physical memory. The operating system must select a page to remove from memory to make room for the new page.</p>
      
      <h3>What is Page Replacement?</h3>
      <p>When a program references a page not currently in memory (a page fault), the OS must bring that page into memory from disk. If all frames are occupied, the OS must choose a page to evict using a page replacement algorithm. The goal is to minimize page faults and thus improve system performance.</p>
      
      <h3>Why is Page Replacement Important?</h3>
      <p>Page replacement is essential for several reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Memory Utilization:</strong> Allows systems to run more processes than would fit in physical memory</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Good algorithms significantly reduce page faults and improve system responsiveness</li>
        <li><strong>Multitasking:</strong> Enables efficient sharing of limited physical memory among multiple processes</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Memory:</strong> Forms the core of virtual memory systems by managing the mapping between virtual and physical memory</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Page Replacement Algorithms</h2>

      <div class="algorithm">
        <h3>1. FIFO (First-In, First-Out)</h3>
        <p>The simplest page replacement algorithm. The OS keeps track of all pages in memory in a queue, with the oldest page at the front. When a page needs to be replaced, the page at the front of the queue is selected for removal.</p>

          <div class="algorithm-pros">
            <h4>Advantages:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Simple to understand and implement</li>
              <li>Low overhead</li>
              <li>Fair - treats all pages equally</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          <div class="algorithm-cons">
            <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Poor performance in many cases</li>
              <li>Suffers from Belady's Anomaly (more frames can lead to more page faults)</li>
              <li>Doesn't consider page usage frequency or recency</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

      </div>

      <div class="algorithm">
        <h3>2. Optimal Page Replacement</h3>
        <p>An idealized algorithm that replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future. This algorithm is impossible to implement in practice as it requires knowledge of future page references, but serves as a benchmark for other algorithms.</p>
        
        <div class="algorithm-details">
          <div class="algorithm-pros">
            <h4>Advantages:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Provides the lowest possible page fault rate</li>
              <li>Useful for comparison with practical algorithms</li>

              <li>Only useful for theoretical analysis and comparison</li>

      </div>

      <div class="algorithm">
        <h3>3. LRU (Least Recently Used)</h3>
        <p>Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period of time. This algorithm is based on the observation that pages which have been heavily used in the past will probably be heavily used again in the near future.</p>

      <div class="algorithm">
        <h3>4. LFU (Least Frequently Used)</h3>
        <p>Replaces the page that has been used least frequently. The algorithm maintains a count of how often each page has been referenced and selects the page with the smallest count for replacement.</p>
        
        <div class="algorithm-details">

              <li>Requires counters for each page</li>

      <div class="algorithm">
        <h3>5. MFU (Most Frequently Used)</h3>
        <p>Replaces the page that has been used most frequently. The algorithm maintains a count of how often each page has been referenced and selects the page with the largest count for replacement.</p>

            <h4>Advantages:</h4>
            <ul>

      <div class="algorithm">
        <h3>6. Clock (Second Chance)</h3>
        <p>A more efficient approximation of LRU. Pages are arranged in a circular list with a reference bit for each page. When a page is referenced, its bit is set to 1. The algorithm scans the pages like a clock hand, looking for a page with reference bit 0. Pages with bit 1 are given a "second chance" by having their bit cleared.</p>
