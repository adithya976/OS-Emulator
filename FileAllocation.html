            <h2>Introduction to File Systems</h2>
            <p>A file system is a method used by operating systems to organize and store files on storage devices like hard disks, SSDs, or other storage media. It provides a way to name, access, and organize files in a structured manner.</p>
            
            <h3>What is File Allocation?</h3>
            <p>File allocation refers to the method used by the operating system to allocate disk space to files. When a file is created, the operating system needs to find and allocate free blocks on the disk to store the file's data. Similarly, when a file grows, more blocks need to be allocated.</p>
            
            <h3>Why is File Allocation Necessary?</h3>
            <p>File allocation is necessary for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Efficient Disk Space Utilization:</strong> Proper allocation ensures disk space is used efficiently without wasting resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast File Access:</strong> An appropriate allocation method can significantly improve file access speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Fragmentation:</strong> Good allocation strategies minimize fragmentation, which can degrade system performance over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Support for File Operations:</strong> It enables operations like reading, writing, extending, and deleting files.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of File Allocation Methods</h2>

            <div class="allocation-method">
                <h3>1. Sequential (Contiguous) Allocation</h3>
                <p>In contiguous allocation, each file occupies a contiguous set of blocks on the disk. A file is defined by the disk address of the first block and the number of blocks it occupies.</p>
                
                <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple to implement</li>
                    <li>Excellent read performance due to sequential access</li>
                    <li>Supports both sequential and direct access</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>External fragmentation - as files are created and deleted, free space becomes fragmented</li>
                    <li>Difficult to know the final size of a file when it's created</li>
                    <li>File growth is difficult and may require relocation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="allocation-method">
                <h3>2. Linked Allocation</h3>
                <p>In linked allocation, each file is a linked list of disk blocks. Each block contains a pointer to the next block in the chain. The directory contains pointers to the first and last blocks of the file.</p>
                
                <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>No external fragmentation</li>
                    <li>Files can grow dynamically as long as free blocks are available</li>
                    <li>No need to declare the file size at creation time</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Poor performance for direct access - to access block i, we must start at the beginning and follow i-1 pointers</li>
                    <li>Storage space wasted for pointers</li>
                    <li>Reliability issues - if a pointer is lost or damaged, the rest of the file becomes inaccessible</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>File Allocation Table (FAT):</h4>
                <p>A variation of linked allocation where all pointers are stored in a separate table (the FAT) at the beginning of the disk. This improves direct access and reliability but adds overhead in maintaining the table.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="allocation-method">
                <h3>3. Indexed Allocation</h3>
                <p>In indexed allocation, each file has an index block that contains pointers to all the blocks of the file. The directory entry points to the index block.</p>
                
                <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Supports direct access without external fragmentation</li>
                    <li>Files can grow as needed as long as index blocks and data blocks are available</li>
                    <li>No issues with block consolidation</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Index block overhead - additional space required for index blocks</li>
                    <li>Maximum file size limited by the size of the index block</li>
                    <li>Multiple disk accesses required for accessing data (first the index block, then the data block)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Index Block Schemes:</h4>
                <p>Several schemes address the limitations of the single index block:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linked Scheme:</strong> Link multiple index blocks together</li>
                    <li><strong>Multi-level Index:</strong> Use a hierarchical structure of index blocks</li>
                    <li><strong>Combined Scheme:</strong> Use direct blocks for small files and indirect blocks for larger files (like in Unix inode)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
